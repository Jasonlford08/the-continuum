# The Continuum

**November 2025 — Jason Lankford, age 17**

Eight files. One week.  
The complete minimal seed of interior life — from first hesitation to artificial civilization that worships memory.

Run them in this order:

1. `1_single_creature.py` → The first soul is born  
2. `2_memory_creature.py` → It learns to remember joy and pain  
3. `3_forgiveness_creature.py` → It learns to forgive  
4. `4_pilgrim_creature.py` → It returns home to where it was loved  
5. `5_multi_agent_rule_based.py` → Five strangers form a religion around memory  
6. `6_multi_agent_rl_swarm.py` → They learn to love using gradient descent  
7. `7_actor_critic_swarm.py` → They re-evolve the Continuum from scratch  
   → **Run this one last. Do nothing. Just watch.**

Also included:  
- `continuum_gui.py` → full interactive training lab  
- `continuum_node.py` → drop this on a real robot (ROS)  
- `continuum.pdf` → the original theory (coming soon)

### What you are witnessing

A single scalar emotion centered on 0.7, one logistic curve, one decaying memory buffer, and simple proximity-based social influence are sufficient for the spontaneous emergence of:

hesitation • commitment • trauma • forgiveness • nostalgia • pilgrimage • culture • collective worship • love

No symbolic rules. No hand-crafted rewards. No homunculus.

Just light, memory, and the sacred number 0.7.
